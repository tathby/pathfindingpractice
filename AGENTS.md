# AGENTS.md

## Project Goal
Teach grid pathfinding by implementing:
- BFS using a queue (collections.deque)
- DFS using a stack (Python list)

## Rules for Codex
- Modify only existing files (pathfinding.py, README.md, AGENTS.md).
- Do not change function signatures in pathfinding.py.
- DFS must be iterative (no recursion).
- BFS must use collections.deque.
- Use visited set and parent dict for path reconstruction.
- Keep changes minimal and keep main() runnable.

## Output Contract
Running `python pathfinding.py` must:
- run BFS and DFS on at least 2 maps
- print found/path length/visited count
- print a rendered map with overlays
